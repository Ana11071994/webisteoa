        <h1>About Quantum Machine Learning (QML)</h1>
        <p>
          Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines principles from quantum computing with machine learning techniques. It seeks to leverage the unique properties of quantum systems such as superposition, entanglement and quantum parallelism to enhance traditional machine learning models, enabling faster computation, improved data handling, and solving complex problems that classical systems struggle with.

            <h3>Quantum Computing Principles</h3>
            <li><strong>Qubits:</strong>The basic unit of quantum information, analogous to classical bits but capable of existing in multiple states simultaneously (superposition).</li>
            <li><strong>Superposition:</strong>A quantum system can be in multiple states at once, allowing parallel computations.</li>
            <li><strong>Entanglement:</strong>Qubits can be interconnected such that the state of one qubit can instantaneously affect another, leading to faster data processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Quantum Gates and Circuits: </strong>Quantum operations applied to qubits to perform computations.</li>
          </div>
          <div class="application-box">
            <h3>Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning</h3>
            <li>Quantum computing promises the potential to dramatically improve the performance of certain machine learning algorithms. Classical models like support vector machines, neural networks, and clustering can benefit from quantum speedups in data processing and optimization.

      </div>
      <h3>Challenges in QML</h3>
        <li><strong>Quantum Hardware Limitations:  </strong>Current quantum computers are in their early stages (noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era), meaning they are prone to errors and cannot handle large, complex computations yet.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithm Development:   </strong>Developing quantum machine learning algorithms that outperform classical algorithms is still in its infancy.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Input:  </strong>Efficiently encoding large datasets into quantum computers remains a challenge due to quantum system constraints.</li>
