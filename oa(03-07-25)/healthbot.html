            <strong>How HealthBot Works</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            HealthBot combines cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP)
            and machine learning technologies to provide accurate and
            personalized healthcare advice. Here's a quick overview of how it
            functions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 1: Symptom Input </strong> Users enter their symptoms
              or health concerns in the chatbot.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 2: NLP Processing </strong>The AI processes the input
              through NLP to understand medical terminology and map symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 3: Diagnosis Prediction </strong> Our machine
              learning models use healthcare data to predict potential health
              conditions and offer advice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 4: User Recommendations </strong> Based on the
              diagnosis, HealthBot provides recommendations for lifestyle
              changes, preventive actions, or professional medical help if
              necessary.
            </li>
          </ul>
