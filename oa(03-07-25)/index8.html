          AICTE Sponsored ATAL Faculty Development Program: A Leap towards
          Excellence in AI Research and Innovation This comprehensive program is
          designed to empower educators with innovative strategies to integrate
          sustainability into their curricula, effectively manage resources, and
          implement green campus initiatives. Participants will engage with
          experts, explore best practices, and collaborate on actionable plans
          to foster sustainable education. The presentation titled
          "Transformative Applications of AI", presented by Sri Kamani @ Object
          Automation gave exploration of how artificial intelligence (AI) is
          revolutionizing various industries. The key sections include:
          Introduction to AI and Transformation: AI is introduced as a branch of
          computer science enabling systems to perform tasks that require human
          intelligence. It emphasizes how AI drives efficiency, innovation, and
          growth in industries by transforming operations, products, and
          services. AI in Industry: The presentation highlighted how AI is
          applied in industries like healthcare,finance, retail,manufacturing,
          transportation, and education, showcasing its potential to improve
          diagnostics, risk management, customer experience, and operational
          efficiency. AI Use Cases: Various AI models, such as Recurrent Neural
          Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Generative
          Adversarial Networks (GANs), are applied to real-world challenges,
          including image recognition, video analysis, anomaly detection, and
          data augmentation. AI in Software Development: Discussed about the
          transformative role of AI in automating tasks like code generation,
          testing, and debugging, increasing efficiency and improving outcomes
          in software development. AI Tools: The presentation also covers tools
          like GitHub Copilot for code generation, AdobeSensei for
          creative design, and platforms like Wix ADI for web development,
          illustrating how AI can streamline processes and enhance user
          experiencesâ€‹. our company Object Automation can offer a range of
